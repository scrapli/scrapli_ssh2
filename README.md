scrapli_ssh2
============

This is the ssh2-python plugin for [scrapli](https://github.com/carlmontanari/scrapli).

If you would like to use scrapli, but prefer to use ssh2-python as a driver for whatever reason (perhaps you are into
 ludicrous speed!), this is the library for you!
 
Please see the main [scrapli repo](https://github.com/carlmontanari/scrapli) for much more information.
